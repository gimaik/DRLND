![DRLNDCert](https://github.com/gimaik/DRLND/blob/master/DRLND_Cert.png)

This repository contains the three projects completed in the course. The projects require the implementation of deep reinforcement learning algorithms:
1. Project 1: Navigation - Deep Q-Learning
2. Project 2: Continuous Control - Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
3. Project 3: Collaboration and Competition - Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
